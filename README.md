## Chess Match Predictor

What if you could predict the results of a chess match without knowing the players' individual moves?

The main goal of our project was to create a neural network that could anticipate the outcome of a chess game, given only a small number of variables. More specifically, our group wanted to create a machine learning model that was more effective at predicting the results of chess matches than simpler methods, such as random guessing. Below is our report describing the process of how the neural network was created, the results the model yielded, and what conclusions can be drawn from this information.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Systemoutprintjhb/Chess_Predictor_Network/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
