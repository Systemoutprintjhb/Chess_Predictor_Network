# Chess Match Predictor

What if you could predict the results of a chess match without knowing the players' individual moves?

The main goal of our project was to create a neural network that could anticipate the outcome of a chess game, given only a small number of variables. More specifically, our group wanted to create a machine learning model that was more effective at predicting the results of chess matches than simpler methods, such as random guessing. Below is our report describing the process of how the neural network was created, the results the model yielded, and what conclusions can be drawn from this information.

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Defined formally, machine learning (ML) is the subfield of artificial intelligence which studies computer algorithms that can improve their performance without being programmed to make specific changes. This discipline focuses on the use of ML models to produce predictions (numerical values) based on an inputted data set. These values can be used to represent a great number of things, including classifications of an input, predictions supported by factors in the data set, and original generations/creations based on the input. The algorithms become increasingly accurate by completing this process several times, each time changing the functions applied to the variables, in order to generate predictions closer to the target (expected) values. More specifically, each column (variable) in the data set is given a "weight", which represents how the computer thinks it influences the final output. As the model repeats the process described above, the algorithm changes these weights to try to become consistently more accurate.
